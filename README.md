# exercise 2 ffmpeg

# Task 1
Estimate the processing power needed to execute such operations on your computer  
  To encode two 6 second videos took ~5.2 seconds. 5.2/(6+6) ~= 5/12 so it took roughly 5/12 of my CPU.  

Estimate the maximum number of such operations on your computer  
  I can run 2 of these processes concurrently on my computer
